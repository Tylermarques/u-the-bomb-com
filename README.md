# U-The-Bomb.com

A little weekend project. The site itself is pretty simple - type in some text and get a url that lets you share it and give friends a fun message telling them they're awesome.
The part of this that I was really looking to get up and running was working with Kustomize and ArgoCD on my local homelab K8s cluster.

## TODOS

- [ ] Add a "share" button to the page
- [ ] Add a "copy link" button to the page
- [ ] Separate the manifests in my `HomeLab` repo so that I can push updates to that repo on the finishing of builds to this repo
